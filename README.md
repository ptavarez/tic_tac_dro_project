# Tic-Tac-Dro

Hey team! I'm going to create some form of blog as I code my first project. The goal is to create a functional tic-tac-toe game. I don't expect it to be easy, so be prepared for a couple of angry posts!

## Setting Up (Feb 6)

Before:

Setting up doesn't seem to hard... Just following simple intructions to be honest. I just finished downloading this template (thanks GA!). Next I have to set up a github repo, and then I have to deploy. Easier typed than done though.

After:

As I thought, setting was not bad at all. I feel like the steps could have been slightly more clear, but overall pretty straight forward. I'll be working on the game's engine tomorrow... I'm nervous but excited to start!
